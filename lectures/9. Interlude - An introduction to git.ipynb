      "==================================\n",
      "\n",
      "We have already learned about Python, Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib, so you can already write code to carry out scientific analysis. When doing research, we just use combinations of these packages (and sometimes domain-specific packages, for example astronomy-specific packages) to analyze data and obtain scientific results. As your analysis gets more complicated, so will your code, and it is inevitable that you will introduce *bugs* into the code. A *bug* is essentially a mistake in the code that is causing results to be incorrect.\n",
      "\n",
      "One very important concept in programming is called *version control* - this basically means that we record changes to the program over time. That way, if it stops working, then we can always go back to a previous version that we know worked. You can think of it as keeping a backup of the code every time you make a significant change.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several available tools to do version control, but in this lecture I will show you a little about a tool called [git](http://git-scm.com/). The basic syntax is:\n",
      "\n",
      "    $ git <command> <options>\n",
      "\n",
      "where ``$`` indicates we are typing the commands in the normal command-line, *not* IPython.\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting up git\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Before you start using ``git`` you need to use the following two commands:\n",
      "\n",
      "    $ git config --global user.name \"Your Name Here\"\n",
      "    $ git config --global user.email \"your_email@example.com\"\n",
      "\n",
      "to tell ``git`` who you are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basics of git\n",
      "-------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The first concept to know about is that of a *repository*, which you can think of as a special folder inside which we will be keeping the history of the code. You can start off by creating a normal directory, then going inside it:\n",
      "\n",
      "    $ mkdir test_repo\n",
      "    $ cd test_repo\n",
      "\n",
      "Now initialize the repository:\n",
      "\n",
      "    $ git init\n",
      "    Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/tom/test_repo/.git/\n",
      "\n",
      "The ``test_repo`` directory is now a repository. The only difference to a normal directory is that it includes a hidden folder called ``.git`` that keeps track of the history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we have to create a file that we want to track the history for. You can create a Python script any way you usually do - if you want to do it all in the Terminal, you can type:\n",
      "\n",
      "    $ pico test.py\n",
      "\n",
      "then write a couple of lines of code, for example:\n",
      "\n",
      "    # test program\n",
      "    print \"Hello, World!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "press control-X to exit and say yes to the question about saving the file. Once the file has been saved, you can type ``ls`` to make sure the file is there:\n",
      "\n",
      "    $ ls\n",
      "    test.py\n",
      "\n",
      "Type ``git status`` to find out the current state of the repository:\n",
      "\n",
      "    $ git status\n",
      "    # On branch master\n",
      "    #\n",
      "    # Initial commit\n",
      "    #\n",
      "    # Untracked files:\n",
      "    #   (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n",
      "    #\n",
      "    #\ttest.py\n",
      "    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n",
      "\n",
      "You will notice that ``test.py`` is an *untracked* file which means the history will *not* be saved. By default, not all files are tracked, only the ones added with:\n",
      "\n",
      "    $ git add <file>\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's add ``test.py`` to be tracked:\n",
      "\n",
      "    $ git add test.py\n",
      "\n",
      "If you now type\n",
      "\n",
      "    $ git status\n",
      "\n",
      "you will notice that the file is now in the category 'changes to be committed':\n",
      "\n",
      "    $ git status\n",
      "    # On branch master\n",
      "    #\n",
      "    # Initial commit\n",
      "    #\n",
      "    # Changes to be committed:\n",

      "    #\n",
      "    #\tnew file:   test.py\n",
      "    #\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that it will be included in the next version. We can now finally *commit*, which means that we create a new version, or *revision*. To do this we use the ``commit`` command which is used as:\n",
      "\n",
      "    $ git commit -m \"<commit message here>\"\n",
